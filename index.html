        <p>Sykes died, and after two years they tracked Gordon Kemp down and
            brought him back, because he was the only man who knew anything about
            the death. Kemp had to face a coroner's jury in Switchpath, Arizona,
            a crossroads just at the edge of the desert, and he wasn't too happy
            about it, being city-bred and not quite understanding the difference
            between "hicks" and "folks."
        </p>
        <p>The atmosphere in the courtroom was tense. Had there been great
            wainscoted walls and a statue of blind Justice, it would have been
            more impersonal and, for Kemp, easier to take. But this courtroom was a
            crossroads granger's hall in Switchpath, Arizona.</p>
            
            <p>The presiding coroner was Bert Whelson, who held a corncob pipe instead
            of a gavel. At their ease around the room were other men, dirt-farmers
            and prospectors like Whelson. It was like a movie short. It needed only
            a comedy dance number and somebody playing a jug.</p>
            
            <p>But there was nothing comic about it. These hicks were in a position
            to pile trouble on Kemp, trouble that might very easily wind up in the
            gas chamber.</p>
            
            <p>The coroner leaned forward. "You got nothin' to be afeard of, son, if
            your conscience is clear."</p>
            
            <p>"I still ain't talking. I brought the guy in, didn't I? Would I of done
            that if I'd killed him?"</p>
            
            <p>The coroner stroked his stubble, a soft rasping sound like a rope being
            pulled over a wooden beam.</p>
            
            <p>"We don't know about that, Kemp. <i>Hmm.</i> Why can't you get it through
            your head that nobody's accusing you of anything? You're jest a feller
            knows something about the death of this here Alessandro Sykes. This
            court'd like to know exactly what happened."</p>
            
            <p>He hesitated, shuffled.</p>
            
            <p>"Sit down, son," said the coroner.</p>
            
            <p>That did it. He slumped into the straight chair that one of the men
            pushed up for him, and told this story.</p>
        <hr class="chap">
        <p>I guess I better go right back to the beginning, the first time I ever
            saw this here Sykes.</p>
            
            <p>I was working in my shop one afternoon when he walked in. He watched
            what I was doing and spoke up.</p>
            
            <p>"You Gordon Kemp?"</p>
            
            <p>I said yes and looked him over. He was a scrawny feller, prob'ly sixty
            years old and wound up real tight. He talked fast, smoked fast, moved
            fast, as if there wasn't time for nothin', but he had to get on to
            somethin' else. I asked him what he wanted.</p>
            
            <p>"You the man had that article in the magazine about the concentrated
            atomic torch?" he said.</p>
            
            <p>"Yeah," I told him. "Only that guy from the magazine, he used an awful
            lot of loose talk. Says my torch was three hundred years ahead of its
            time." Actually it was something I stumbled on by accident, more or
            less. The ordinary atomic hydrogen torch&mdash;plenty hot.</p>
            
            <p>I figured out a ring-shaped electro-magnet set just in front of
            the jet, to concentrate it. It repelled the hydrogen particles and
            concentrated them. It'll cut anything&mdash;anything. And since it got
            patented, you'd be surprised at the calls I got. You got no idea how
            many people want to cut into bank vaults an' the side doors of hock
            shops. Well, about Sykes....</p>
            
            <p>I told him this magazine article went a little too far, but I did have
            quite a gadget. I give him a demonstration or two, and he seemed
            satisfied. Finally I told him I was wasting my time unless he had a
            proposition.</p>
            
            <p>He's lookin' real happy about this torch of mine, an' he nods.</p>
            
            <p>"Sure. Only you'll have to take a couple of weeks off. Go out West.
            Arizona. Cut a way into a cave there."</p>
            
            <p>"Cave, huh?" I said. "Is it legal?" I didn't want no trouble.</p>
            
            <p>"Sure it's legal," he tells me.</p>
            
            <p>"How much?"</p>
            
            <p>He says he hates to argue.</p>
            
            <p>"If you'll get me into that place&mdash;and you can satisfy yourself as to
            whether it's legal&mdash;I'll give you five thousand dollars," he says.</p>
            
        <hr class="chap">
        <p>Now, five thousand berries cuts a lot of ice for me. Especially for
            only two weeks' work. And besides, I liked the old guy's looks. He was
            queer as a nine-dollar bill, mind you, and had a funny way of carryin'
            on, but I could see he was worth the kind of money he talked.</p>
            
            <p>He looked like he really needed help, too. Aw, maybe I'm just a boy
            scout at heart. As I say, I liked him, money or no money, and chances
            are I'd have helped him out for free.</p>
            
            <p>He came to see me a couple more times and we sweated out the details.
            It wound up with him and me on the train and my torch and the other
            gear in the baggage car up front. Maybe some of you remember the day we
            arrived here. He seemed to know a lot of people here. Mm? I thought so.
            He told me how many years he had been coming out to Switchpath.</p>
            
            <p>He told me lots of things. He was one of the talkin'est old geezers
            I ever did see. I understood about one ninth of what he said. He was
            lonely, I guess. I was the first man he ever called in to help him with
            his work, and he spilled the overflow of years of workin' by himself.</p>
            
            <p>About this Switchpath proposition, he told me that when he was just a
            punk out of college, he was a archyologist roamin' around the desert
            lookin' for old Indian stuff, vases and arrowheads and such stuff. And
            he run across this here room in the rock, at the bottom of a deep cleft.</p>
            
            <p>He got all excited when he told me about this part of it. Went on a
            mile a minute about plasticine ages and messy zorics and pally o'
            lithographs or something. I called him down to earth and he explained
            to me that this room was down in rock that was very old&mdash;a couple of
            hundred thousand years, or maybe a half million.</p>
            
            <p>He said that rock had been there either before mankind had a start here
            on earth, or maybe about the same time as the missing link. Me, I don't
            care about dead people or dead people's great grandfather's, but Sykes
            was all enthusiastic.</p>
            
            <p>Anyhow, it seems that this cave had been opened by some sort of an
            earthquake or something, and the stuff in it must have been there all
            that time. What got him excited was that the stuff was machinery of
            some kind and must have been put there 'way <i>before there was any human
            beings on earth at all</i>!</p>
            
            <p>That seemed silly to me. I wanted to know what kind of machinery.</p>
            
            <p>"Well," he says, "I thought at first that it was some sort of a radio
            transmitter. Get this," he says. "Here is a machine with an antenna on
            top of it, just like a micro-wave job. And beside it is another machine.</p>
            
            <p>"This second machine is shaped like a dumbbell standing on one end. The
            top of it is a sort of covered hopper, and at the waist of the machine
            is an arrangement of solenoids made out of some alloy that was never
            seen before on this earth.</p>
            
            <p>"There's gearing between this machine and the other, the transmitter. I
            have figured out what this dumbbell thing is. It's a recorder."</p>
            
            <p>I want to know what is it recording. He lays one finger on the side of
            his nose and winks at me.</p>
            
            <p>"Thought," he says. "Raw thought. But that isn't all. Earthquakes,
            continental shifts, weather cycles, lots more stuff. It integrates all
            these things with thought."</p>
            
            <p>I want to know how he knows all this. That was when he told me that he
            had been with this thing for the better part of the last thirty years.
            He'd figured it out all by himself. He was real touchy about that part
            of it.</p>
            
            <p>Then I began to realize what was the matter with the poor old guy. He
            really figured he had something big here and he wanted to find out
            about it. But it seems he was a ugly kid and a shy man, and he wanted
            to make the big splash all by himself. It wouldn't do for him just to
            be known as the man who discovered this thing.</p>
            
            <p>"Any dolt could have stumbled across it," he'd say. He wanted to find
            out everything there was about this thing before he let a soul know
            about it. "Greater than the Rosetta Stone," he used to say. "Greater
            than the nuclear hypotheses." Oh, he was a great one for slinging the
            five-dollar words.</p>
            
            <p>"And it will be Sykes who gave this to the world," he would say. "Sykes
            will give it to humanity, complete and provable, and history will be
            reckoned from the day I speak."</p>
            
            <p>Oh, he was wacky, all right. I didn't mind, though. He was harmless,
            and a nicer little character you'd never want to meet.</p>
            
        <hr class="chap">
        <p>Funny guy, that Sykes. What kind of a life he led I can only imagine.
            He had dough&mdash;inherited an income or something, so he didn't have the
            problems that bother most of the rest of us. He would spend days in
            that cavern, staring at the machines. He didn't want to touch them. He
            only wanted to find out what they were doing there. One of them was
            running.</p>
            
            <p>The big machine, the dumbbell-shaped one, was running. It didn't
            make no noise. Both machines had a little disk set into the side. It
            was half red, half black. On the big machine, the one he called the
            recorder, this here disk was turning. Not fast, but you could see it
            was moving. Sykes was all excited about that.</p>
            
            <p>On the way out here, on the train, he spouted a lot of stuff. I don't
            know why. Maybe he thought I was too dumb to ever tell anybody about
            it. If that's what he thought, he had the right idea. I'm just a
            grease-monkey who happened to have a bright idea. Anyway, he showed me
            something he had taken from the cave.</p>
            
            <p>It was a piece of wire about six feet long. But wire like I have never
            seen before or since. It was about 35 gauge&mdash;like a hair. And crooked.
            Crimped, I mean. Sykes said it was magnetized too. It bent easy enough,
            but it wouldn't kink at all, and you couldn't put a tight bend in it. I
            imagine it'd dent a pair of pliers.</p>
            
            <p>He asked me if I thought I could break it. I tried and got a gash in
            my lunch-hook for my trouble. So help me, it wouldn't break, and it
            wouldn't cut, and you couldn't get any of those crimps out of it. I
            don't mean you'd pull the wire and it would snap back. No. You couldn't
            pull it straight at all.</p>
            
            <p>Sykes told me on the train that it had taken him eight months to cut
            that piece loose. It was more than just tough. It fused with itself.
            The first four times he managed to cut it through, he couldn't get the
            ends apart fast enough to keep them from fusing together again.</p>
            
            <p>He finally had to clamp a pair of steel blocks around the wire, wait
            for enough wire to feed through to give him some slack and then put
            about twelve tons on some shears to cut through the wire. Forged
            iridium steel, those cutters were, and that wire left a heck of a hole
            in them.</p>
            
            <p>But the wire parted. He had a big helical spring hauling the wire
            tight, so that the instant it parted it was snapped out of the way. It
            had to be cut twice to get the one piece out, and when he put the ends
            together they fused. I mean, both on the piece he took out and the two
            free ends in the machine&mdash;not a mark, not a bulge.</p>
            
            <p>Well, you all remember when we arrived here with all that equipment,
            and how we hired a car and went off into the desert. All the while the
            old man was happy as a kid.</p>
            
            <p>"Kemp, my boy," he says, "I got it decoded. I can read that tape. Do
            you realize what that means? Every bit of human history&mdash;I can get it
            in detail. Every single thing that ever happened to this earth or the
            people in it.</p>
            
            <p>"You have no idea in what detail that tape records," he says. "Want to
            know who put the bee on Alexander the Great? Want to know what the name
            of Pericles' girl friend really was? I have it all here. What about
            these Indian and old Greek legends about a lost continent? What about
            old Fort's fire-balls? Who was the man in the iron mask? I have it,
            son, I have it."</p>
            
            <p>That was what went on all the way out there, to that place in the dry
            gulch where the cave was.</p>
            
            <p>You wouldn't believe what a place that was to get to. How that old guy
            ever had the energy to keep going back to it I'll never know. We had to
            stop the car about twenty miles from here and hoof it.</p>
            
            <p>The country out there is all tore up. If I hadn't already seen the
            color of his money I'd 'a said the heck with it. Sand an' heat an' big
            rocks an' more places to fall into and break your silly neck&mdash;<i>Lord!</i></p>
            
            <p>Me with a pack on my back too, the torch, the gas and a power supply
            and all. We got to this cleft, see, and he outs with a length of rope
            and makes it fast to a stone column that's eroded nearby. He has a
            slip-snaffle on it. He lowers himself into the gulch and I drop the
            gear down after him, and then down I go.</p>
            
            <p>Brother, it's dark in there. We go uphill about a hundred and fifty
            yards, and then Sykes pulls up in front of a facing. By the light of
            his flash I can see the remains of a flock of campfires he's made there
            over the years.</p>
            
            <p>"There it is," he says. "It's all yours, Kemp. If that
            three-hundred-years-in-the-future torch of yours is any good&mdash;prove it."</p>
            
            <p>I unlimbered my stuff and got to work, and believe me it was hard, slow
            goin'. But I got through. It took nine hours before I had a hole fit
            for us to crawl through, and another hour for it to cool enough so's we
            could use it.</p>
            
        <hr class="chap">
        <p>All that time the old man talked. It was mostly bragging about the job
            he'd done decoding the wire he had. It was mostly Greek to me.</p>
            
            <p>"I have a record here," he says, swishin' his hunk of wire around, "of
            a phase of the industrial revolution in Central Europe that will have
            the historians gnashing their teeth. But have I said anything? Not me.
            Not Sykes!</p>
            
            <p>"I'll have the history of mankind written in such detail, with such
            authority, that the name of Sykes will go into the language as a
            synonym for the miraculously accurate." I remember that because he said
            it so much. He said it like it tasted good.</p>
            
            <p>I remember once I asked him why it was we had to bother cutting in.
            Where was the hole he had used?</p>
            
            <p>"That, my boy," he says, "is an unforseen quality of the machines. For
            some reason they closed themselves up. In a way I'm glad they did. I
            was unable to get back in and I was forced to concentrate on my sample.
            If it hadn't been for that, I doubt that I would ever had cracked the
            code."</p>
            
            <p>So I asked him what about all this&mdash;what were the machines and who left
            them there and what for? All this while I was cutting away at that rock
            facing. And, man! I never seen rock like that. If it <i>was</i> rock, which,
            now, I doubt.</p>
            
            <p>It come off in flakes, in front of my torch. <i>My</i> torch, that'll cut
            anything. Do you know that in those nine hours I only got through
            about seven and a half inches of that stuff? And my torch'll walk into
            laminated bank vaults like the door was open.</p>
            
            <p>When I asked him he shut up for a long time, but I guess he wanted to
            talk. He sure was enthusiastic. And besides, he figured I was too dumb
            to savvy what he was talking about. As I said before, he was right
            there. So he run off about it, and this is about how it went&mdash;</p>
            
            <p>"Who left these machines here or how they operate, we may never know.
            It would be interesting to find out, but the important thing is to get
            the records and decode them all."</p>
            
            <p>It had taken him awhile to recognize that machine as a recorder. The
            tipoff was that it was running and the other one, the transmitter, was
            not.</p>
            
            <p>He thought at first that maybe the transmitter was busted, but after
            a year or two of examining the machines without touching them he began
            to realize that there was a gear-train waiting by the tape where it fed
            through the gismo that crimped it.</p>
            
            <p>This gear train was fixed to start the transmitter, see? But it was
            keyed to a certain crimp in the tape. In other words, when something
            happened somewhere on earth that was just the right thing, the crimper
            would record it and the transmitter would get keyed off.</p>
            
            <p>Sykes studied that set-up for years before he figured the particular
            squiggle in that wire that would start that transmitter to sending.
            Where was it sending to? Why? Sure, he thought about that. But that
            didn't matter to him.</p>
            
            <p>What was supposed to happen when the tape ran out? Who or what would
            come and look at it when it was all done? You know, he didn't care.
            He just wanted to read that tape, is all. Seems there's a lot of guys
            write history books and stuff. And he wanted to call them liars. He
            wanted to tell them the way it really was. Can you imagine?</p>
            
            <p>So there I am, cutting away with my super-torch on what seems to be a
            solid wall made out of some stuff that has no right to be so tough. I
            can still see it.</p>
            
            <p>So dark, and me with black goggles on, and the doc with his back to
            me so's he won't wreck his eyes, spoutin' along about history and the
            first unbiased account of it. And how he was going to thrust it on the
            world and just kill all those guys with all those theories.</p>
            
            <p>I remember quitting once for a breather and letting the mercury cells
            juice up a bit while I had a smoke. Just to make talk I ask Sykes when
            does he think that transmitter is going to go to work.</p>
            
            <p>"Oh," he says. "It already did. It's finished. That's how I knew
            that my figuring was right. That tape has a certain rate through the
            machine. It's in millimeters per month. I have the figure. It wouldn't
            matter to you. But something happened a while ago that made it possible
            to check. July sixteenth, nineteen hundred and forty-five, to be exact."</p>
            
            <p>"You don't tell me," I says.</p>
            
            <p>"Oh," he says, real pleased, "but I do! That day something happened
            which put a wiggle in the wire there&mdash;the thing I was looking for all
            along. It was the crimp that triggered the transmitter. I happened to
            be in the cave at the time.</p>
            
            <p>"The transmitter started up and the little disk spun around like mad.
            Then it stopped. I looked in the papers the next week to see what it
            was. Nothing I could find. It wasn't until the following August that I
            found out."</p>
            
            <p>I suddenly caught wise.</p>
            
            <p>"Oh&mdash;the atom bomb! You mean that rig was set up to send something as
            soon as an atomic explosion kicked off somewhere on earth!"</p>
            
        <hr class="chap">
        <p>He nodded his head. By the glare of the red-hot rock he looked like a
            skinny old owl.</p>
            
            <p>"That's right. That's why we've got to get in there in a hurry. It was
            after the second Bikini blast that the cave got sealed up. I don't know
            if that transmission is ever going to get picked up.</p>
            
            <p>"I don't know if anything is going to happen if it is picked up. I
            do know that I have the wire decoded and I mean to get those records
            before anybody else does."</p>
            
            <p>If that wall had been any thicker I never would've gotten through. When
            I got my circle cut and the cut-out piece dropped inside, my rig was
            about at its last gasp. So was Sykes. For the last two hours he'd been
            hoppin' up an' down with impatience.</p>
            
            <p>"Thirty years' work," he kept saying. "I've waited for this for thirty
            years and I won't be stopped now. Hurry up! Hurry up!"</p>
            
            <p>And when we had to wait for the opening to cool I thought he'd go wild.
            I guess that's what built him up to his big breakdown. He sure was
            keyed up.</p>
            
            <p>Well, at last we crawled into the place. He'd talked so much about it
            that I almost felt I was comin' back to something instead of seeing it
            for the first time.</p>
            
            <p>There were the machines, the big one about seven feet tall,
            dumbbell-shaped, and the little one sort of a rounded cube with a bunch
            of macaroni on top that was this antenna he was talking about.</p>
            
            <p>We lit a pressure lantern that flooded the place with light&mdash;it was
            small, with a floor about nine by nine&mdash;and he jumped over to the
            machines.</p>
            
            <p>He scrabbles around and hauls out some wire. Then he stops and stands
            there looking stupid at me.</p>
            
            <p>"What's the matter, Doc?" I say. I called him Doc.</p>
            
            <p>He gulps and swallows.</p>
            
            <p>"The reel's empty. It's empty! There's only eight inches of wire here.
            Only&mdash;" and that was when he fainted.</p>
            
            <p>I jumped up right away and shook him and shoved him around a little
            until his eyes started to blink. He sits up and shakes himself.</p>
            
            <p>"<i>Refilled</i>," he says. He is real hoarse. "Kemp! They've been here!"</p>
            
            <p>I began to get the idea. The lower chamber is empty. The upper one is
            full. The whole set-up is arranged to run off a new recording. And
            where is Sykes' thirty years' work?</p>
            
            <p>He starts to laugh. I look at him. I can't take that. The place is too
            small for all that noise. I never heard anybody laugh like that. Like
            short screams, one after the other, fast. He laughs and laughs.</p>
            
            <p>I carry him out. I put him down outside and go back in for my gear. I
            can hear him laughing out there and that busted-up voice of his echoing
            in the gulch. I get everything onto the back pack and go to put out the
            pressure lantern when I hear a little click.</p>
            
            <p>It's that transmitter. The little red and black disk is turning around
            on it. I just stand there watching it. It only runs for three or four
            minutes. And then it begins to get hot in there.</p>
            
            <p>I got scared. I ducked out of the hole and picked up Sykes. He didn't
            weigh much. I looked back in the hole. The cave was lit up. Red. The
            machines were cherry-red, straw-color, white, just that quick. They
            melted. I saw it. I ran.</p>   
        <hr class="chap">
        <div class="image">
            <img src="images/illus.jpg" alt="illus photo">
        </div>
        
        <hr class="chap">
        <p>I don't hardly remember getting to the rope and tying Sykes on and
            climbing up and hauling him up after me. He was quiet then, but
            conscious. I carried him away until the light from the gulch stopped
            me. I turned around to watch.</p>
            
            <p>I could see a ways down into the gulch. It was fillin' up with lava.
            It was lightin' up the whole desert. And I never felt such heat. I ran
            again.</p>
            
            <p>I got to the car and dumped Sykes in. He shifted around on the seat
            some. I asked him how he felt. He didn't answer that but mumbled a lot
            of stuff.</p>
            
            <p>Something like this.</p>
            
            <p>"They knew we'd reached the atomic age. They wanted to be told when.
            The transmitter did just that. They came and took the recordings and
            refilled the machine.</p>
            
            <p>"They sealed off the room with something they thought only controlled
            atomic power could break into. This time the transmitter was
            triggered to human beings in that room. Your torch did it, Kemp&mdash;that
            three-hundred-years-in-the-future torch! They think we have atomic
            power! They'll come back!"</p>
            
            <p>"Who, doc? Who?" I says.</p>
            
            <p>"I don't know," he mumbles. "There'd be only one reason why
            someone&mdash;some creature&mdash;would want to know a thing like that. And
            that's so they could stop us."</p>
            
            <hr class="chap">
            
            <p>So I laughed at him. I got in and started the car and laughed at him.</p>
            
            <p>"Doc," I said, "we ain't goin' to be stopped now. Like the papers say,
            we're in the atomic age if it kills us. But we're in for keeps. Why,
            humanity would have to be killed off before it'd get out of this atomic
            age."</p>
            
            <p>"I know that, Kemp&mdash;I know&mdash;that's what I mean! What have we done? What
            have we done?"</p>
            
            <p>After that he's quiet a while and when I look at him again I see he's
            dead. So I brought him in. In the excitement I faded. It just didn't
            look good to me. I knew nobody would listen to a yarn like that.</p>
            
            <hr class="chap">
            
            <p>There was silence in the courtroom until somebody coughed, and then
            everyone felt he had to make a sound with his throat or his feet. The
            coroner held up his hand.</p>
            
            <p>"I kin see what Brother Kemp was worried about. If that story is true
            I, for one, would think twice about tellin' it."</p>
            
            <p>"He's a liar!" roared a prospector from the benches. "He's a murderin'
            liar! I have a kid reads that kind of stuff, an' I never did like to
            see him at it. Believe me, he's a-goin' to cut it out as of right now.
            I think this Kemp feller needs a hangin'!"</p>
            
            <p>"Now, Jed!" bellowed the coroner. "If we kill off this man we do it
            legal, hear?" The sudden hubbub quieted, and the coroner turned to the
            prisoner.</p>
            
            <p>"Listen here, Kemp&mdash;somethin' jest occurred to me. How long was it from
            the time of the first atom blast until the time that room got sealed
            up?"</p>
            
            <p>"I dunno. About two years. Little over. Why?"</p>
            
            <p>"An' how long since that night you been talking about, when Sykes died?"</p>
            
            <p>"Or was murdered," growled the prospector.</p>
            
            <p>"Shut up, Jed. Well, Kemp?"</p>
            
            <p>"About eighteen mon&mdash;No. Nearer two years."</p>
            
            <p>"Well, then," said the coroner, spreading his hands. "If there was
            anything in your story, or in that goofy idea of the dead man's about
            someone comin' to kill us off&mdash;well, ain't it about time they did?"</p>
            
            <p>There were guffaws, and the end of the grange hall disappeared in a
            burst of flame. Yelling, cursing, some screaming, they pushed and
            fought their way out into the moonlit road.</p>
            
            <p>The sky was full of ships.</p>

                destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your

                Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
                by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person

                used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

                even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
                paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
                Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
                agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;

                1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
                Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
                of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
                works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
                States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
                United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
                claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
                displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
                all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
                that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
                free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
                works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
                Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
                comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
                same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when

                in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

                received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
                with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you

                Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
                electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
                computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
                exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
                from people in all walks of life.

                Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
                assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
                goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
                remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
                Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
                and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
                generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
                Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
                Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

                Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
                public support and donations to carry out its mission of
                increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
                freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
                array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
                ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
                status with the IRS.

                The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
                charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
                States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
                considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
                with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
                where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
                DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
                visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

                <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
                While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
                have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
                against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
                approach us with offers to donate.

                International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
                any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
                outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

                Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
                Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
                freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
                distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
                volunteer support.
                </div>
                
                <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
                Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
                editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
                the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
                necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
                edition.
